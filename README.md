Hello!

1> What your project is/does (and what it's called)

This is a game made from PYGAME Library, inspired by the chrome dino game when you loose internet connection.

2> Why you made your project
I made this project to learn more about the capablities of Python code, and to make a game if we lose internet.

3> How you made your project
I made this project using Python, and used Youtube for help with syntax.

4> What you struggled with and what you learned
It was a bit difficult learning how to use the Pygame library, but when I got the hang of it, it was pretty intuitive.

Thanks for reading!
